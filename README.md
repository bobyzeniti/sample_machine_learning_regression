# Machine Learning regression model
Sample Machine learning regression model using XGBoost and SimpleImputation. <br>
It uses an example of an order book with >5 million instances, trying to predict the closing price for hundreds of stocks listed on Nasdaq in the last minutes of the auction. <br>

This is a simple implementation of XGBoost with mean imputation and random shuffling to split the training and testing datasets and can be adapted for other regression problems.
